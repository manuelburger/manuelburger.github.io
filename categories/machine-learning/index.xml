We propose a novel approach named Multi-Modal UMLS Graph Learning (MMUGL) for learning meaningful representations of medical concepts using graph neural networks over knowledge graphs based on the unified medical language system. These representations are aggregated to represent entire patient visits and then fed into a sequence model to perform predictions at the granularity of multiple hospital visits of a patient.</description></item></channel></rss>
