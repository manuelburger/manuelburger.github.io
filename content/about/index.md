# Welcome to my Homepage

I am a PhD student in machine learning and passionate about biomedical applications and health care
solutions. I am driven to solve challenging health care problems with machine learing to advance
patient care and clinical decision making.

I joined the [Biomedical Informatics Group](https://bmi.inf.ethz.ch) at
ETH Z端rich in 2022. Get in touch here [here](https://bmi.inf.ethz.ch/people/person/manuel-burger)
and learn more about open project proposals [here](https://bmi.inf.ethz.ch/bsc-msc).

## Interests

I am interested in applications for clinical decision support, predictive modeling
in the clinical setting (e.g. Intensive Care Units), and scientific discovery by means
of data analysis and machine learning. For this, my interests in machine learning
revolve around, but not exclusively:

- Time-Series Modeling
- Self-Supervised Learning; especially for Time-Series and Graph-strucutred Data
- Knowledge Extraction and Representation Learning thereof
- Transfer Learning in the Clinical Domain
- Natural Language Processing
- Graph Neural Networks

## Education

- PhD in Machine Learning, ETH Z端rich *ongoing since 2022*
- Master in Data Science, ETH Z端rich
- Bachelor of Computer Science, ETH Z端rich
