# Welcome to my Homepage

I am a PhD student in machine learning and passionate about biomedical applications and health care
solutions. My aim is to improve predictive performance of machine learning
models in the biomedical domain by building on existing prior knowledge and facilitating
the use of this knowledge in our modeling approaches.

I joined the [Biomedical Informatics Group](https://bmi.inf.ethz.ch) at
ETH Z端rich in 2022. Get in touch here [here](https://bmi.inf.ethz.ch/people/person/manuel-burger)
and learn more about open project proposals [here](https://bmi.inf.ethz.ch/bsc-msc).

## Interests

I am interested in applications for clinical decision support, predictive modeling
in the clinical setting (e.g. Intensive Care Units), and scientific discovery by means
of data analysis and machine learning. For this, my interests in machine learning
revolve around, but not exclusively:

- Time-Series Modeling
- Self-Supervised Learning; especially for GNNs and Time-Series
- Knowledge Extraction and Representation Learning thereof
- Transfer Learning in the Clinical Domain
- Graph Neural Networks
- Natural Language Processing

## Education

- PhD in Machine Learning, ETH Z端rich *ongoing since 2022*
- Master in Data Science, ETH Z端rich
- Bachelor of Computer Science, ETH Z端rich
