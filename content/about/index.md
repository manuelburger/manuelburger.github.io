**Driven to solve challenging health care problems with machine learning solutions.**

My research centers on developing foundation models for healthcare and creating the large-scale data resources necessary to train them.

I am particularly interested in how foundation models can generalize across diverse clinical settings and enable new capabilities for understanding complex patient data. As part of this work, I have led the development of ICareFM, a foundation model for intensive care trained on hundreds of thousands of patient stays from hospitals worldwide.

A core aspect of my work involves bridging the gap between cutting-edge machine learning research and real-world clinical applications. I am actively involved as a machine learning lead in prospective clinical studies at Inselspital Bern, including the BEACON interventional trial, where we are deploying AI systems directly into ICUs to support clinical decision-making.

Looking forward, I am exploring how to make foundation models more accessible and interactive for clinicians through conversational AI interfaces — working toward digital patient twins that enable intuitive exploration of complex temporal health data.
